"Use Feature-Policy header name for now",40652,closed,2020-11-19T15:09:42Z,p8,1,10,5,3,2020-11-19T16:15:31Z,"### Summary    In 90e710d7672b928ce6bb3ec05f8f2c05338be6c9 the FeaturePolicy middleware was renamed  to PermissionsPolicy as this will be new name of the header as used by browsers.  The Permissions-Policy header requires a different implementation and  isn't yet supported by all browsers. To avoid having to rename the  middleware in the future  we keep the new name for the Middleware  but  use the old implementation and header name.    ### Other Information    The permissions-policy changed the format of the data to a structured header:  w3c/webappsec-permissions-policy#383    So the following:  ```   \"usb 'self'; autoplay https://example.com; payment https://secure.example.com\"   ```  Would need to change to  ```     \"usb=(self)  autoplay=(https://example.com)  payment=(https://secure.example.com)\"   ```"

"Make exclusive endless ranges produce `gt` queries",40628,closed,2020-11-16T06:58:40Z,raghubetina,1,98,5,4,2020-11-18T18:20:25Z,"Before this patch  a `where` with an **exclusive**  **endless** `Range`  argument:    ```ruby  Thing.where(id: 42...::Float::INFINITY)  ```    Produced:    ```sql  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM \"things\" WHERE \"things\".\"id\" >= ?  [[\"id\"  42]]  ```    I expected that using an exclusive endless `Range` would produce a `>`  query  equivalent to:    ```ruby  Thing.where(Thing.arel_table[:id].gt(42))  ```    Instead  it does the same thing as an _inclusive_ endless `Range`   producing a `>=` query.    By comparison (using Ruby 2.6 and 2.7s implicit beginless and endless  syntax):     - `Thing.where(id: ..42)` (inclusive  beginless) produces `<=`:        ```sql      SELECT COUNT(*) FROM \"things\" WHERE \"things\".\"id\" <= ?  [[\"id\"  42]]      ```   - `Thing.where(id: ...42)` (exclusive  beginless) produces `<`:        ```sql      SELECT COUNT(*) FROM \"photos\" WHERE \"photos\".\"id\" < ?  [[\"id\"  42]]      ```   - `Thing.where(id: 42..)` (inclusive  endless) produces `>=`:        ```sql      SELECT COUNT(*) FROM \"photos\" WHERE \"photos\".\"id\" >= ?  [[\"id\"  42]]      ```    It seems least-surprising that `Thing.where(id: 42...)` (exclusive  endless)  would produce `>`  symmetrically to the beginless exclusive behavior.    A counterargument is that `Range`s are inclusive or exclusive of their  _ending_  and not their beginning; so `42..::Float::INFINITY` and  `42...::Float::INFINITY` are the same. So it's reasonable that they  produce the same query when used as arguments to `where`.    However  I believe it's worth breaking with mathematical purity here to  complete the inequalities available without dropping down to Arel;  especially as the style becomes more popular with Ruby 2.6 and 2.7's  implicit endless and beginless `Range` syntax.    Therefore  this patch differentiates between _exclusive_ and _inclusive_  endless `Range`s when building predicates  and makes the former produce  `gt` queries instead of `gteq`.    Resolves #40627.

"Wrap evaluation of db/seeds.rb with the executor",40626,open,2020-11-15T16:47:22Z,jonathanhefner,1,35,76,6,Null,"Before #34953  when using the `:async` Active Job queue adapter  jobs enqueued in `db/seeds.rb`  such as Active Storage analysis jobs  would cause a hang (see #34939).  Therefore  #34953 changed all jobs enqueued in `db/seeds.rb` to use the `:inline` queue adapter instead.  (This behavior was later limited to only take effect when the `:async` adapter was configured  see #35905.)  However  inline jobs in `db/seeds.rb` cleared `CurrentAttributes` values (see #37526).  Therefore  #37568 changed the `:inline` adapter to wrap each job in its own thread  for isolation.  However  wrapping a job in its own thread affects which database connection it uses.  Thus inline jobs can no longer execute within the calling thread's database transaction  including seeing any uncommitted changes.  Additionally  if the calling thread is not wrapped with the executor  the inline job thread (which is wrapped with the executor) can deadlock on the load interlock.  And when testing (with `connection_pool.lock_thread = true`)  the inline job thread can deadlock on one of the locks added by #28083.    Therefore  this commit reverts the solutions of #34953 and #37568  and instead wraps evaluation of `db/seeds.rb` with the executor.  This eliminates the original hang from #34939  which was also due to running multiple threads and not wrapping all of them with the executor.  And  because nested calls to `executor.wrap` are ignored  any inline jobs in `db/seeds.rb` will not clear `CurrentAttributes` values.    Alternative fix for #34939.  Reverts #34953.  Reverts #35905.  Partially reverts #35896.    Alternative fix for #37526.  Reverts #37568.    Fixes #40552.    ---    It's worth noting that `rails db:seed` will no longer run `:async` adapter jobs  because those jobs will wait for a lock acquired via `executor.wrap`  and then be killed by `Concurrent::ThreadPoolExecutor` when the process exits.  However  this makes the `:async` adapter behave like all other non-`:inline` adapters  so I think it's reasonable.  If we specifically want Active Storage analysis jobs to run during `rails db:seed`  we can add something like the following to `load_seed`:    ```ruby  ActiveSupport.on_load(:active_storage_job) { self.queue_adapter = :inline }  ```    If there is interest in that  I will open a follow-up PR.

"Fix preventing_writes for granular swapping",40615,closed,2020-11-13T21:30:42Z,eileencodes,1,90,14,4,2020-11-17T18:24:54Z,"When we implemented granular connection swapping we treated  `prevent_writes` similarly to `role` and `shard`. However  it's a little  different. `prevent_writes` is a feature of a conneciton whereas `role`  and `shared` are used to lookup a connection. A writing connection that  wants to prevent writes doesn't get stored in the pool as such   `prevent_writes` is added as a way to change behavior of a connection.    Because of this when `preventing_writes?` calls  `ActiveRecord::Base.current_preventing_writes` the lookup is on the  wrong class if we're using granular swapping. Instead we need to lookup  the `prevent_writes` from the class that called `connected_to` rather  than `ActiveRecord::Base`. To do that I've done the following:    1) Added access to the `connection_specification_name` as `owner_name`  on the pool so the connection can access it.  2) Call `safe_constantize` on the `owner_name` since the  `connected_to_stack` stores the class as a class and not a string.  3) Now we can call `safe_constantize` on the klass that we got out of  the pool to be able to look up the correct `prevent_writes` from the  stack.    I benchmarked this and the two versions were pretty close  although this  is a little bit slower.    I tried a few other ways of fixing this. I first tried adding  `prevent_writes` to the connection in `retrieve_connection` based on the  `current_preventing_writes` but then that behavior only worked correctly  for ActiveRecord connections. If we already had a connection and  `retrieve_connection` isn't called then the tests testing that behavior  would fail. This was the best way to not introduce confusing differences  between global and granular connections.    Fixes #40559    cc/ @seejohnrun "
